# Frequently Asked Questions

### My favorite channel is not on the playlist.

Start by asking our community for help via [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/iptv-org/discussions). It is quite possible that someone already has a link to the channel you need and they just haven't added it to our playlist yet.

But keep in mind that not all TV channels are available for viewing online, and in this case there is little we can do about it.

### Are you planning to include a Video On Demand (VOD) to the playlist?

No.

### Why is the channel on the iptv-org.github.io but not in the playlist?

The site contains a list of all TV channels in the world and only those of them for which we have working stream links are included in the playlists.

#### Channels

Each channel in any playlist can have one of three statuses:

- The channel may be working
But it may be broadcasting some kind of placeholder (for example, from Wink).

- The channel may not be working
The more such channels in a playlist, the more difficult it will be to scroll through the playlist in the player or on TV. But perhaps the playlist will be updated someday and the channel will work properly. It could also be a one-time glitch (for example, a verification timeout), and (possibly) it will soon become available.

### Are these playlists free?

Possibly. At least, that's what the sources distributing them claim. But no one offers any guarantees.

### Can I add a radio broadcast?

Yes, if it is a [visual radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_radio) in which a video and audio are shown at the same time.

### Why don't you accept links to Xtream Codes server?

Xtream Codes streams tend to be very unstable, and often links to them fail very quickly, so it's easier for us to initially exclude them from the playlist than to search for expired ones every day.
